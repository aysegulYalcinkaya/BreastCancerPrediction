# BreastCancerPrediction
Breast cancer data includes 569 observations of cancer biopsies, each with 32 characteristics (variables).
One feature is an identification number (ID), another is a cancer diagnosis, and 30 are numerical
laboratory measurements. The diagnosis is coded as "M" to indicate malignant or "B" for indicate benign.
Data Preprocessing, EDA and standardization techniques are implemented before training the prediction model.
In the master branch Decision Tree Classifier is used. The accuracy of the model is 94.81%
In the model_v2 branch Random Forest Classifier is used. The accuracy of the model is 96.49%
